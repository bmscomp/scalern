## Scalern

You may already guess the purpose of this project by its name, it is for learning more about scala
and of course kafka, and kafka stream, yes learning is amazing, coming from java background may make
this experience more exiting for me, Try to write functional code from the start can be hard, getting
out of the box from the object-oriented perspective can be more hard for me

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will
start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).
